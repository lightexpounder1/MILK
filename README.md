Transform thoughts into music instantly, anywhere. Bridging imagination and creation with AI.

## Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered application that generates music based on user input, effectively translating thoughts and prompts into musical compositions. Whether you're a musician looking for inspiration or someone exploring the intersection of AI and creativity, this app serves as a powerful tool for spontaneous music creation.

## Features

### Explore Page

1. Recommendation Systems
   - Utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to suggest music based on user preferences and input.

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
   - Analyzes text data such as song descriptions and artist bios to understand themes and styles.

3. Audio Feature Extraction
   - Extracts characteristics from audio files, including genre, mood, and tempo, to inform music generation.

### Create Page

1. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
   - Generates new music samples based on user prompts or existing samples, enhancing creativity through AI.

2. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
   - Creates new music by manipulating and combining existing samples, offering novel compositions.

3. Sequence-to-Sequence Models
   - Uses LSTM and Transformers to generate music sequences based on user input, predicting subsequent notes and beats.

4. Amper Music AI (or similar models)
   - Specifically designed for music generation, capable of producing original tracks based on user inputs and preferences.

### Additional Models

1. Audio Classification
   - Identifies genres, moods, or emotions in music samples, enhancing music recommendation and generation.

2. Music Information Retrieval
   - Extracts relevant information from audio files, such as tempo and instrumentation, to enrich music analysis and creation.
